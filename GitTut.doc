Hello Peeps

Git? How it works?

Let's have a quick overview !!

Please find the below command cheatsheet for your reference in order to get basic idea on how git vcs works.

git init 				                    ---> to initiate the repo , [.git directory will be created & removing this will stop the tracking of repository. ]
git branch sns_plot				          ---> create our own branch 
git checkout sns_plot			          ---> selecting our branch to modify code 
git branch -a					              ---> this will display all branches 
vi xyz.py						                ---> modify your code 
git status						              ---> check the git status if it is workign directory
git add -A						              ---> move it to staging area 
git commit -m "message"		          ---> commit your changes to your branch, no effect on local master branch / remote repository
git push -u origin sns_plot		      ---> pushed your branch to remote repository [ That's the reason, unit test is performed. ] 
git checkout master 			          ---> switch to master branch
git pull origin master		          ---> Pull the changes from master before updating your branch
git merge sns_plot				          ---> merge your branch into master branch
git push origin master		          ---> push your master branch to remote master branch
git branch --merged 			          ---> merged branches are listed here
git branch -d sns_plot 		          ---> delte the branch locally
git push origin --delete sns_plot   ---> delete the branch from remote repo
git log 						                ---> log related to commit operation
git diff 						                ---> to get the list of modifications you made
